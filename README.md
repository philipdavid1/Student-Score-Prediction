## Introduction

Student performance analysis and prediction using datasets has become an essential component of modern education systems. With the increasing availability of data on student demographics, academic history, and other relevant factors, schools and universities are using advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to gain insights into student performance and predict future outcomes. This approach helps educators identify areas of improvement, personalize learning experiences, and provide targeted support to struggling students. Furthermore, student performance analysis and prediction can also aid in decision-making processes for school administrators and policymakers, helping them allocate resources more effectively. In this article, we will explore the benefits of using datasets for student performance analysis and prediction and discuss some of the methods and tools used in this field.

## Understanding the Problem Statement

This project understands how the student’s performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, and Lunch and Test preparation course.

The primary objective of higher education institutions is to impart quality education to their students. To achieve the highest level of quality in the education system, knowledge must be discovered to predict student enrollment in specific courses, identify issues with traditional classroom teaching models, detect unfair means used in online examinations, detect abnormal values in student result sheets, and predict student performance. This knowledge is hidden within educational datasets and can be extracted through data mining techniques.

This project focuses on evaluating students’ capabilities in various subjects using a classification task. Data classification has many approaches, and the decision tree method and probabilistic classification method are utilized here. By performing this task, knowledge is extracted that describes students’ performance in the end-semester examination. This helps in identifying dropouts and students who require special attention, enabling teachers to provide appropriate advising and counseling
